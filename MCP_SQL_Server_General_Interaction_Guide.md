Best For: Initial setup, schema modifications
```

#### **2. READ Operations:**
```
Purpose: Query and retrieve data (SELECT statements)
MCP Usage: Data exploration, reporting, analysis
Best For: Information gathering, reporting
```

#### **3. UPDATE Operations:**
```
Purpose: Modify existing data (INSERT, UPDATE statements)

## üó£Ô∏è Effective Prompt Patterns

### **1. The CLEAR Pattern:**

**C**ontext - **L**ocation - **E**xpected - **A**ction - **R**equirements

#### **Good Example:**
```
"I need to analyze customer data (Context) from the sales database (Location). 
I expect to see purchase patterns (Expected) by retrieving (Action) 
all orders from the last 6 months with customer details (Requirements)."
```

#### **Poor Example:**
```
"Show me some data"
```

### **2. The SMART Pattern:**

**S**pecific - **M**easurable - **A**ctionable - **R**elevant - **T**ime-bound

#### **Good Example:**
```
"Show me the top 10 products (Specific & Measurable) 
by sales volume (Actionable & Relevant) 
from Q4 2024 (Time-bound)"
```

### **3. The SCOPE Pattern:**

**S**elect - **C**onditions - **O**rder - **P**agination - **E**xclusions

#### **Good Example:**
```
"Select all employee records (Select) 
where department is 'IT' and status is active (Conditions)
ordered by hire date descending (Order)
limit to first 20 results (Pagination)
excluding terminated employees (Exclusions)"

## üîí Best Practices & Safety

### **1. Safe Query Practices:**

#### **Always Include These Elements:**
```
‚úÖ Specific table names and column references
‚úÖ Clear filtering conditions and limits
‚úÖ Explicit result set size expectations
‚úÖ Time boundaries for date-based queries
‚úÖ Backup considerations for modification operations
```

#### **Never Do These Things:**
```
‚ùå Request operations without WHERE clauses on large tables
‚ùå Ask for unlimited result sets without pagination
‚ùå Perform bulk modifications without explicit confirmation
‚ùå Query sensitive data without proper authorization
‚ùå Execute operations that could impact system performance
```

### **2. Performance Considerations:**

#### **Efficient Query Patterns:**
```
"Limit results to top N records when exploring large tables"
"Use indexed columns in WHERE clauses for better performance"
"Specify only needed columns instead of SELECT * for large tables"
"Include appropriate time ranges for date-based queries"
"Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries when possible"
```

#### **Resource Management:**
```
"Monitor query execution time and cancel if taking too long"
"Consider table size before requesting full data scans"
"Use sampling techniques for analysis of very large tables"
"Batch large operations to avoid system overload"
"Schedule heavy operations during off-peak hours"
```

### **3. Data Protection:**

#### **Sensitive Data Handling:**
```
"Exclude personally identifiable information from general queries"
"Mask or anonymize sensitive data in analysis results"
"Use appropriate access controls for confidential information"
"Log and audit access to sensitive data tables"
"Follow data retention policies for query results"
```

#### **Change Management:**
```
"Always test modifications on small datasets first"
"Create backups before performing bulk data changes"
"Document all significant data modifications"
"Use transactions for multi-step data operations"
"Verify changes before committing large updates"
```
